## Hi there, I'm [RD](resume.rdieud.com)!! ðŸ‘‹

I love learning and sharing knowledge. I freelance (open for job opportunities) and code in my free time on projects I'm passionate about including **Open Source**.
My main stack is **#React**, **#NextJS**, #NodeJS (**#ExpressJS**), **#AWS** and occasionally **#Symfony**. My favorite architectures are **#microservices** and **#menorepo**.
